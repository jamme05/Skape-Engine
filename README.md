# Skape Engine
Skape as in Shape or Skapelse (you're allowed to cringe)

namespace: sk

## Note:
Currently doesn't have some helper application for selecting modules, so either just change the UUIDs manually or copy and paste them.
The engine requires a certain amount of components from the modules. These will be documented in the future.
